The dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Depression Survey/Dataset for Analysis dataset. 
Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. 
Feel free to use the original dataset, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Notes:

A number of data artifacts have been left in the synthetic dataset.

Files
train.csv - the training dataset; class is the binary target (either e or p)
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict target class for each row
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

Every dataset contains valuable insights waiting to be discovered. We begin by exploring the dataset to better understand the characteristics of each feature.
We will start with the value counts for categorical variables, along with the distributions of numerical features, to uncover any patterns, trends, or anomalies.

Focus and Objectives: Our primary goal is to explore the relationships between various features and the target variable: mental health status. 
                      By analyzing this data, we aim to identify the factors that most significantly contribute to mental health conditions.

Some key questions we aim to answer include:

What factors are most influential in determining mental health status?
How do age and gender correlate with mental health conditions?
Does work-related stress or job type have a significant impact on mental health?
Are certain lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits or physical activity, associated with better or worse mental health outcomes?
How do academic or professional pressures influence mental health status?
